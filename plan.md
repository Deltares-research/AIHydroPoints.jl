# Next steps for working on this project

## Main goal
The main goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model for predicting tides, surges and their interaction. The model will be trained on historical data and will be able to make predictions for future events. The model will be implemented in Julia and will be designed to be easily extensible and adaptable to different datasets and configurations

## Next steps
1. [x] Make the unit tests work again.
2. [x] Create a small test dataset
3. [x] Create unit tests for each of the models (tides, surges, interaction, waves) that run fast.
4. [x] Create additional tests for code that is not tested at all.
    a. [x] figure out which code is not tested at all, and which code is tested but not well enough.
    b. [x] write tests for the code that is not tested at all, and improve the tests for the code that is tested but not well enough.
5. [x] Clean up the code and make it more modular and reusable.
6. Make training scripts more similar and consistent
    a. [x] Create a Separate data-structure for the training data, building on the MultiTimeSeries.jl package, and use it in the training code.
    b. [x] Make data loading identical across all training scripts, with a single load_data function that can load any dataset based on the settings.
    c. [x] Make the training loop identical across all training scripts, with a single train_model function that can train any model based on the settings.
    d. [x] Make the output generation (plots, saved models, etc.) identical across all training scripts, with a single save_output function that can save any output based on the settings.
7. Make training fully controllable from the toml input file, and make it possible to run training from the command line with a specified toml file.
8. Write a separate script for inference
9. Rename `"nstations"` / `"nwind"` to `"nlocations_output"` / `"nlocations_input"` throughout all model settings and constructors for consistency across model types (wave, surge, interaction all use different informal names today).

## Checklist for each step:
- all source should eventually be in src/ and all tests should be in test/ and test data should be in test_data/
- make code compilable and runnable
- consider to add new unit tests for the new code
- fix all unit tests `pixi run julia --project -e "using Pkg; Pkg.test()"`
- make sure that the code is well documented and that the documentation is up to date.
- update docs/ (e.g. docs/settings.md) when the public API or settings change.
- Check if README.md is up to date and update it if necessary.
- Adapt the status in plan.md
- run the unit tests and make sure that they all pass.
- run check_training_scripts.sh to smoke-test all training scripts

## General notes
- we use pixi to install python and julia etc. But we use julia packages in Project.toml.
- we think before we write code. We raise potential issues with the user before continuing
- we discuss design decisions with the user before implementing them, and we make sure that the user is happy with the design before proceeding.
- we keep output of unit tests in test/temp. We clean this folder before running the tests, and leave files for inspection after the tests have run. We make sure that the output of the tests is informative and useful for debugging.

## Status

Steps 1–6 are complete. The new model hierarchy (`AbstractModel → AbstractFluxModel →
AbstractSurgeModel / AbstractTideModel / AbstractWaveModel / AbstractInteractionModel →`
concrete models) is fully implemented, tested, and all legacy source files removed.
406 unit tests pass. Training scripts: `train_surge.jl`, `train_tide.jl`,
`train_waves.jl`, `train_interaction.jl`. All use `load_data`, a shared `train_model!`
interface, unified plotting, `runid`/`description` metadata, and write `run_settings.toml`
for reproducibility. Smoke-tested via `check_training_scripts.sh`.
